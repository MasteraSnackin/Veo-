## 🎥 DEMO FLOW (2-3 min)

show these videos

V1 is currently limited to generating 8‑second videos time to generated is 5mins, and there are text constraints. I am trying to create a video of around 1 minutes, but each 8‑second segment cannot display more than three lines of information. I need to increase the video duration to accommodate more content.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I1d_dozJMcM6U9rTvNL9fhsm3MDd8e7P/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I1d_dozJMcM6U9rTvNL9fhsm3MDd8e7P/view?usp=drive_link)

I created two videos, but the character appears as two different personas. I need to make the character consistent, using the last frame of each video to create the next one for visual consistency.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IjLJCEsilUeHET7KdHTgqL3WTq_klC_/view?usp=sharing

V3 however not very gen z

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoX1kctMmscY_Kuwcd5sPDPFZEMbwuJ_/view?usp=drive_link

v4 I am keeping the style consistent and making it in a Gen Z TikTok format

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zHhM64GNymdazH_gprsFmE_f5ahEVcjj/view?usp=drive_link

The result is a video over 1 minute long, which is consistent, but unfortunately there are still issues with the text being generated correctly in the video. The background is set in a Shoreditch-style environment, including areas like Brick Lane.


**If Demo Fails:** Use screenshots in `frontend/screenshots/`

## ❓ ANTICIPATED Q&A


### Q: "How do you ensure data accuracy?"
**A:** *"We cross-validate from multiple authoritative sources - TfL for transport, UK Police for crime, Ofsted for schools. Our scoring flags inconsistencies."*


### Q: "What's your monetization?"
**A:** *"Freemium model - basic free, premium £9.99/month for saved searches and alerts. Plus API licensing to estate agents."*


### Q: "How is this different from Rightmove?"
**A:** *"Rightmove shows properties, we show neighborhoods. We're the intelligence layer before the listing layer."*, because of current limiation with ScanSan data set but, been told they working on this


### Q: "Can it work outside London?"
**A:** *"Yes! Phase 3 includes Manchester, Birmingham. UK has standardized APIs nationwide."*


### Q: "What about API costs and rate limits?"
**A:** *"Redis caching (24-hour TTL), request batching, Modal auto-scaling. Cost per recommendation: under £0.10."*


### Q: "What's your go-to-market?"
**A:** *"University partnerships for students, Facebook parent groups, property forums for investors. Plus API embedding for estate agents."*
